# 📡 ESPHome LoRa SX127x Component (via RadioLib)

A reliable and up-to-date ESPHome external component for LoRa SX1278/SX1276 modules. This component is built on top of the robust and highly maintained [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) library (v6.3.0) to solve the issue of deprecated or broken LoRa custom components in the ESPHome ecosystem.

## ✨ Features
* **Stable & Modern:** Uses the latest `RadioLib` framework fully compatible with modern ESP-IDF and Arduino cores.
* **Plug & Play:** No need to manually download or manage C++ files. Just use `external_components` in your YAML.
* **Hardware Support:** Tested working perfectly with ESP32 boards (including modern variants like ESP32-C3).
* 

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

Add the following configuration to your `esphome.yaml` file. Make sure to adjust the pins and frequency according to your specific hardware setup.

```yaml
